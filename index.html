            <p>I'm a technical writer by trade looking to expand my knoweldge. At this point I'm filling in extra words. I've been a technical writer for almost six years now. 
                I'd like to think that I've gotten a handle on how it works. Yet when someone asks me to add in my biography, I draw a blank. I'm engaged and hopefully soon 
                to be married to the most wonderful woman on the Earth. She is currently in Camobdia until we're able to complete the fiancee visa process. Which has been long.
                Still, we push on. We're at the point where we just need to get her the interview. In fact, I get to go down to see her with my parents in October. It'll be the
                first time in years that my parents have been out of the country. I also think it'll be the first time that my father has been to Asia (Mom went as a missionary).
                I'm extra excited since it's been almost a year since I've seen her in person. We still talk every day and video call, but there is something different when you're 
                in person than when you are far apart. I only have about three weeks until I go. Hopefully my stiches will fall out by then. Last Monday I had my right thyroid 
                removed. I had a massive tumor there. It was a good thing it got removed as well, since it turns out that buried deep in there was some cancer.
