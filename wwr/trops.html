                        <p>Bertram's Alley is a long narrow canyon you found in your backyard. As we go on this seven-night journey, you'll ask yourself the real questions like, "Why does the raft get smaller after each portage?" "Why do the ducks stare ominously from above?" and the beloved question, "Where did this canyon come from that ended up in my backyard?" Sadly, only the last person in the raft gets to answer the canyon's Weather-Keeper, and you are still not sure if the Weather-Keeper tells the truth or not. This is besides the fact you are certainly not going to be the last person in the raft.</p>

                        <p>The Big Blue River is wide. The sky above the river is unusually wide. The smiling eyes below are unusually wide. the river itself feels like a lake with a current. The canyon is girthy. On this delicious two-week trip, you will design, create, and ride down the Big Blue River in a raft-shaped cake of your creation. Be aware that there is no class on baking. Please be aware that the all who raft aboard cakes are snack offerings to the Big Blue. Please be aware that fondant is banned due to the frosting debacle of 2017. Please be aware.</p>

                        <p>This section, as always, is to pay tribute to the this years winners in the semi-annual Bumper Cars. We understand that the nightly portages drained the contestants. We also understand the mandatory nature of Bumper Cars. While we acknoledge that this year's crop of winners were successfully harvested, but we worry the tribute was not enough. No ammount of sorrow will overcome the month-long, 24-hour fight to escape. Unfortuntely escape was only offered to the losers of this year's Bumper Cars.</p>
